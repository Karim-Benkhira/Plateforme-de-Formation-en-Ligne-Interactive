    [question] => A developer is building a web application using Laravel.  They need to separate the application's concerns into distinct components for better organization and maintainability. Which architectural pattern does Laravel inherently utilize to achieve this separation?
    [difficulty] => medium
    [explanation] => Laravel explicitly uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.  This pattern separates the application into three interconnected parts: Models (data), Views (presentation), and Controllers (logic), promoting better code organization and maintainability.
