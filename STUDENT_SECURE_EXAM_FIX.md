# Student Secure Exam Route Fix - Documentation

## Problem Fixed

**Issue**: Accessing `http://localhost:8000/student/courses/1` resulted in a "Route [student.secureExam] not defined" error.

**Error Details**: 
- The student course details views were trying to link to a non-existent route `student.secureExam`
- This route was referenced in multiple course detail templates but was never defined

## Root Cause

The student course detail templates (`courseDetails.blade.php` and `courseDetails-new.blade.php`) contained links to:
```php
{{ route('student.secureExam', $course->quizzes[0]->id) }}
```

But this route was never defined in `routes/web.php`, causing a RouteNotFoundException.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Missing Route
**File**: `routes/web.php`
```php
// Added new route:
Route::get('/student/secure-exam/{id}', [StudentController::class, 'showSecureExam'])
    ->name('student.secureExam');
```

### 2. Created Controller Method
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/StudentController.php`
```php
/**
 * Show secure exam page - redirects to face verification if needed
 */
public function showSecureExam($id)
{
    $quiz = \App\Models\Quiz::with(['course', 'questions'])->findOrFail($id);
    
    // Check enrollment
    $user = auth()->user();
    $isEnrolled = $quiz->course->users()
        ->where('user_id', $user->id)
        ->where('status', 'approved')
        ->exists();
        
    if (!$isEnrolled) {
        return redirect()->route('student.courses')
            ->with('error', 'You must be enrolled in this course to take the exam.');
    }
    
    // Handle face verification if required
    if ($quiz->requires_face_verification) {
        if (!$user->hasStudentPhoto()) {
            return redirect()->route('face-verification.photo-upload')
                ->with('error', 'You need to upload a photo before taking this secure exam.');
        }
        
        return redirect()->route('face-verification.exam', $quiz->id)
            ->with('info', 'Face verification is required for this secure exam.');
    }
    
    // Show secure exam page
    return view('student.secure-exam', compact('quiz'));
}
```

## How It Works

### 1. **Route Access**:
- Students can access: `/student/secure-exam/{quiz_id}`
- Route is protected by authentication and student role middleware

### 2. **Security Checks**:
- ✅ **Enrollment Verification**: Ensures student is enrolled in the course
- ✅ **Face Verification**: Redirects to photo upload if needed
- ✅ **Quiz Validation**: Verifies quiz exists and is accessible

### 3. **Face Verification Integration**:
- **No Face Verification Required**: Shows secure exam page directly
- **Face Verification Required**: 
  - Checks if student has uploaded photo
  - Redirects to face verification process
  - Integrates with existing face verification system

### 4. **User Experience Flow**:
```
Student clicks "Secure Exam" → 
Check enrollment → 
Check face verification requirement → 
If required: Redirect to face verification → 
If not required: Show exam page → 
Student can start exam
```

## Files Modified

### 1. Routes File
**File**: `routes/web.php`
- Added `student.secureExam` route definition
- Integrated with existing middleware protection

### 2. Student Controller
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/StudentController.php`
- Added `showSecureExam()` method
- Implemented enrollment and security checks
- Integrated with face verification system

### 3. Existing View (Already Present)
**File**: `resources/views/student/secure-exam.blade.php`
- View already existed and is functional
- Shows exam information and start button
